I recently tried to organize my workspace and it was a total mess. Papers were scattered everywhere, cables tangled like spaghetti, and I couldn’t even find my favorite notebook. I spent hours sorting through everything, labeling folders, and untangling cords. By the end, it looked neat, but I felt exhausted. Honestly, I’m not sure if the effort will last — I have a habit of letting things pile up again. Still, there’s something satisfying about seeing everything in order, even if only for a short while.

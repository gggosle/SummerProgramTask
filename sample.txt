The wind rattled the windows of the old, abandoned mansion, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Shadows stretched across the walls, cast by the flickering remnants of a long-extinguished fire. Somewhere in the distance, a branch snapped, and for a moment, it sounded like footsteps. Evelyn shivered, pulling her coat tighter around her. She had always been drawn to forgotten places, to the stories they whispered if you paused long enough to listen.
Inside, the furniture was coated in a thin layer of dust, patterns of age etched into every surface. A grand piano sat in the corner, its keys yellowed and warped, yet Evelyn imagined the music it once produced â€” melodies that had filled the house with laughter and sorrow alike. She stepped lightly, careful not to disturb the delicate balance of stillness. Her flashlight beam danced across portraits whose eyes seemed almost alive, following her as she moved.
